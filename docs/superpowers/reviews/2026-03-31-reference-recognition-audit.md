# Reference Recognition Audit

## Task 1 Baseline

### Classification Baseline

Problems:
- wrong recognition
- missed recognition
- wrong variant resolution
- wrong variable recognition
- wrong time-resolution recognition
- inconsistent source semantics that can produce incorrect results

Improvement items:
- manual confirmation gaps
- weak defaults
- missing tests
- maintainability or performance issues that do not directly change results

## Baseline Coverage

- Covered: exact reference lookup, auto-resolve with simulation context, resolution-variant listing, and variable-based reference listing.
- Partially covered: no-context base-name handling and not-found behavior, but only at the `get_reference()` boundary.
- Not covered: directory scanning, descriptor registration, time-resolution inference, station-list generation, or scan/import behavior.
- Not covered: merge semantics for persisted registry descriptors, and runtime consumption paths outside `RegistryManager`.

## RegistryManager Promises Under Review

- Exact-name lookup should win immediately, including case-insensitive matching and alias normalization.
- Base-name lookup should only auto-resolve when simulation time or grid context is provided.
- Variant lookup is keyed off `_LowRes`, `_MidRes`, and `_HigRes` suffixes, with standalone entries treated separately.
- Auto-resolution currently promises sufficient time frequency plus closest grid resolution, with lower waste as a tie-breaker.
- Variable lookup is a simple membership check across loaded reference descriptors.

These promises are documented in `src/openbench/data/registry/manager.py` and will be checked against the broader registry flow in later tasks.
